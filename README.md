# Country Data Finder

This project will use allow users to search for a country by name and display a number of facts about it in a table. Users can continue to add results during their session, allowing them to compare and contrast different countries.

## Purpose

I wanted to come up with something a little different for a teachable React/Redux project, and with my love of geography, this seemed like a natural fit.

## Play with this code!

### Prerequisites

Node, NPM.

### Instructions

Fork and clone the repository and run ```npm install``` to get all required dependencies, and ```npm start``` to start the server. That's it for now!
